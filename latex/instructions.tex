\section{Compile and Run Instructions}

In the Makefile located in the root folder of the project the values of the variables \textit{CPLEX\_VERSION} and \textit{CPLEX\_DIR} in line 9 and 10 have to be adjusted. 

Running \textit{make} in the root folder of the project builds it. Running \textit{make run} builds the project and runs it with the first JSON file (sample01.json).

The executable needs the path of a JSON file as an argument. The usage is as following: 

USAGE:		./ecas \textit{instance\_file} \newline
EXAMPLE:	./ecas ./data/sample01.json
